# Online-Text-Summariser-using-Django
An online text summarizer that takes file, length of required summary and the choice of algorithm as input. You can see the project live at - http://vibhash.pythonanywhere.com. Uses Django as the web framework and sumy (https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy) for the text summarization algorithms. Will add more algorithms from my research papers once I get the permission to do so. If any issues found, please report them.

To run on localhost - 
```sh
$ py manage.py runserver
```
